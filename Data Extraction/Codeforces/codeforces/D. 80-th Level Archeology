VD. 80-th Level Archeology\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aArcheologists have found a secret pass in the dungeon of one of the pyramids of Cycleland. To enter the treasury they have to open an unusual lock on the door. The lock consists of n words, each consisting of some hieroglyphs. The wall near the lock has a round switch. Each rotation of this switch changes the hieroglyphs according to some rules. The instruction nearby says that the door will open only if words written on the lock would be sorted in lexicographical order (the definition of lexicographical comparison in given in notes section).\u000aThe rule that changes hieroglyphs is the following. One clockwise rotation of the round switch replaces each hieroglyph with the next hieroglyph in alphabet, i.e. hieroglyph x (1\u2009\u2264\u2009x\u2009\u2264\u2009c\u2009-\u20091) is replaced with hieroglyph (x\u2009+\u20091), and hieroglyph c is replaced with hieroglyph 1.\u000aHelp archeologist determine, how many clockwise rotations they should perform in order to open the door, or determine that this is impossible, i.e. no cyclic shift of the alphabet will make the sequence of words sorted lexicographically.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and c (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009500\u2009000, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009c\u2009\u2264\u2009106) \u2014 the number of words, written on the lock, and the number of different hieroglyphs.\u000aEach of the following n lines contains the description of one word.
