Recently the authorities of Berland arrested a Reberlandian spy who tried to bring the leaflets intended for agitational propaganda to Berland illegally .

The main part of this algorithm is the following procedure.\u000aAll the m leaflets that are brought by the spy are numbered from 1 to m. After that it's needed to get the answer to q queries of the following kind: "In which leaflet in the segment of numbers [l,\u2009r] the substring of the Absolutely Inadmissible Swearword [pl,\u2009pr] occurs more often?".\u000aThe expert wants you to automate that procedure because this time texts of leaflets are too long.
