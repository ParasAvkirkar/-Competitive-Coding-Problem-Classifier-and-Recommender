aVPolycarp faced the following problem. There are n files in a directory and he needs to delete some of them. Polycarp wants to run a single delete command with filename pattern as an argument. All the files to be deleted should match the pattern and all other files shouldn't match the pattern.
p29
aVPolycarp doesn't know about an asterisk '*', the only special character he knows is a question mark '?' which matches any single character. All other characters in the pattern match themselves only.
p30
aVFormally, a pattern matches a filename if and only if they have equal lengths and all characters in the corresponding positions are equal except when the character in the pattern is '?', in which case the corresponding filename character does not matter.
p31
aVFor example, the filename pattern "a?ba?":
p32
aVmatches filenames "aabaa", "abba.", "a.ba9" and "a.ba.";
p33
aVdoes not match filenames "aaba", "abaab", "aabaaa" and "aabaa.".
p34
aVHelp Polycarp find a pattern which matches files to be deleted and only them or report if there is no such pattern.
