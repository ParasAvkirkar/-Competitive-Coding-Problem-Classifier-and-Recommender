VA. Buy a Shovel\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aPolycarp urgently needs a shovel! He comes to the shop and chooses an appropriate one. The shovel that Policarp chooses is sold for k burles. Assume that there is an unlimited number of such shovels in the shop.\u000aIn his pocket Polycarp has an unlimited number of "10-burle coins" and exactly one coin of r burles (1\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u20099).\u000aWhat is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for the purchase without any change? It is obvious that he can pay for 10 shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of 10-burle coins and not using the coin of r burles). But perhaps he can buy fewer shovels and pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel.\u000aInput\u000aThe single line of input contains two integers k and r (1\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u20091000, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u20099) \u2014 the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from "10-burle coins".\u000aRemember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10, that is, Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint the required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for them without any change.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a117 3\u000aoutput\u000a9\u000ainput\u000a237 7\u000aoutput\u000a1\u000ainput\u000a15 2\u000aoutput\u000a2\u000aNote\u000aIn the first example Polycarp can buy 9 shovels and pay 9117\u2009=\u20091053 burles.
