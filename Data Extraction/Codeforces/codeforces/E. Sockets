Unfortunately, the organizers of the competition were so busy preparing tasks that totally missed an important technical point \u2014 the organization of electricity supplement for all the participants workstations.\u000aThere are n computers for participants, the i-th of which has power equal to positive integer pi. At the same time there are m sockets available, the j-th of which has power euqal to positive integer sj. It is possible to connect the i-th computer to the j-th socket if and only if their powers are the same: pi\u2009=\u2009sj. It is allowed to connect no more than one computer to one socket. Thus, if the powers of all computers and sockets are distinct, then no computer can be connected to any of the sockets.\u000aIn order to fix the situation professor Puch Williams urgently ordered a wagon of adapters \u2014 power splitters. Each adapter has one plug and one socket with a voltage divider between them. After plugging an adapter to a socket with power x, the power on the adapter's socket becomes equal to , it means that it is equal to the socket's power divided by two with rounding up, for example and .\u000aEach adapter can be used only once.
