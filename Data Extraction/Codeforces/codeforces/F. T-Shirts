In all n types of t-shirts go on sale. The t-shirt of the i-th type has two integer parameters \u2014 ci and qi, where ci \u2014 is the price of the i-th type t-shirt, qi \u2014 is the quality of the i-th type t-shirt. It should be assumed that the unlimited number of t-shirts of each type goes on sale in the shop, but in general the quality is not concerned with the price.\u000aAs predicted, k customers will come to the shop within the next month, the j-th customer will get ready to spend up to bj on buying t-shirts.\u000aAll customers have the same strategy. First of all, the customer wants to buy the maximum possible number of the highest quality t-shirts, then to buy the maximum possible number of the highest quality t-shirts from residuary t-shirts and so on. At the same time among several same quality t-shirts the customer will buy one that is cheaper. The customers don't like the same t-shirts, so each customer will not buy more than one t-shirt of one type.\u000aDetermine the number of t-shirts which each customer will buy, if they use the described strategy.
