V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aAs part of his daily job, Chef has to solve problems involving sets. Till now, Chef has been using inefficient methods to solve his set related problem, wasting a lot of his precious time. He has agreed to pay you a lot of money for solving the following problem for him efficiently.\u000aFirst, Chef needs to perform Q operations on a set. Each operation is either:\u000a1. Add a number to the set (if this number is NOT already present in the set).\u000a2. Erase a number from the set (if this number exists in the set).\u000aThen, he needs to find the sum of all elements of the set after performing these Q queries. Your job is to find this sum for him quickly.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains four integers \u2014 Q, S1, A, B. S1 is the first number in the operations. A and B are special constants explained later.\u000aEvery operation Si is represented by a single integer. If Si is odd, then it represents the first operation, otherwise the second type, and in both of them the integer you have to add/delete equals [Si / 2], where [] is the greatest integer (or floor) function.\u000aSi = (A*Si-1 + B) mod 232 when i > 1.\u000aNote: In this problem, the time limit is very tight.
