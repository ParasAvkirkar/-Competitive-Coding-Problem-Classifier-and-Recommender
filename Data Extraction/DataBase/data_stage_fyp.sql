Chefland has a very famous toy shop which sells Rubiks cubes. This shop has interesting rules. Each day it sells cubes of a fixed dimension. Sebi has to buy new cubes daily primarily due to two reasons, one he handles the cube very roughly and the other that he solves the cube so many times during the day. Today the shop is selling K * K * K size Rubiks cubes. In the morning, Sebi bought a cube from the shop. He had just started playing with it, suddenly his cute little sisters asked him to give them C units of the cube. Sebis did not want to disappoint his sisters, so he immediately disassembled the cube into K * K * K units and gave C of those to his sisters. Now Sebi wants to solve the Rubiks cube again, so he thought of going to market and buy some cubes so that he can create a Rubiks cube from those. The newly created cube can be of any dimension. For achieving that, he can disassemble and reassemble the cubes in the way he wants, but he does not want to waste any units of the cubes.
