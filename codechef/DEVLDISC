Diameter of a graph is the maximum value of pairwise shortest distances over all pairs of vertices of the graph. Churu proposed the following algorithm which takes a parameter start_vertex.\u000aAlgorithm (start_vertex):\u000a find out the set of vertices S having maximum value of \u000a  shortest distance from start_vertex.\u000a ans = 0;\u000a for each vertex v in S\u000a  temp = 0;\u000a  for each vertex u in graph G:\u000a   temp = max(temp, shortest distance between u and v).\u000a  ans = max(ans, temp);\u000a return ans;\u000aWhen Devu heard this algorithm, he exclaimed: "What, this does not seem to be correct!". Churu challenged him to give a counter example to disprove the algorithm. You have to help Devu come up with a graph as a counter example to the above algorithm, if one exists.\u000aFormally, You will be given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of the expected graph (counter example Devu is producing). The graph should be undirected, unweighted and connected. The actual diameter of the graph should not be equal to the one returned by the Churu's proposed algorithm. If for the given n, there does not exist any such graph which could act as counter example, print -1.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.\u000aOnly line of each test case contains a single integer n as defined in the problem statement.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, first line should contain the number of edges in the counter-example graph, or -1 if no counter-example exists.\u000aIf a counter example exists, then:\u000aPrint a single line containing an integer m denoting the number of edges in the desired graph\u000aPrint m lines, each line should contain two integers u and v (1-based indexing) denoting an edge of the graph. You should make sure that no two edges in the graph repeat, and that the graph is connected.\u000aIn the next line, print a single integer denoting start_vertex (1-based indexing) passed to the algorithm.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T, n \u2264 50\u000aSubtask\u000aThere is only a single subtask worth 100 points with above mentioned constraints.\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a2\u000a10\u000aOutput:\u000a-1\u000a9\u000a1 2\u000a2 3\u000a3 4\u000a4 5\u000a5 6\u000a6 7\u000a7 8\u000a8 9\u000a9 10\u000a7\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.
