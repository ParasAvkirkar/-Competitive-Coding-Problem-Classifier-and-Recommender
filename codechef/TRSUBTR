V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Russian here\u000aThe Head Chef has a reporting hierarchy for his chefs which is basically a binary tree i.e. Each chef reports to exactly one chef and every chef can take reporting of atmost two chefs . In case two chefs report to the same chef they must report at different times . The time of reporting can have only two values : Morning or Evening ( denoted by M and E , respectively ) .The Head Chef himself is not part of the reporting structure . The Head Chef has found that a new restaurant in Byteland is opening and it is hiring a group of chefs from some existing restaurant . The new restaurant will basically make an offer to one of the chefs and all the chefs directly or indirectly reporting to the chef . The Head Chef is worried that the new restaurant may be taking away some of his chefs . The Head Chef knows that the new restaurant will not change the reporting structure of the chefs . The Head Chef also has access to the reporting structure of the new restaurant in terms of ages of Chefs . The Head Chef wants to know whether there is a need to worry or not . He needs to worry if the new restaurant can possibly be targetting his chefs .\u000aIn short given a tree T and another tree O you need to tell whether O is a subtree of T or not . The node values of T or O need not be distinct as they represent the age of the Chef . Also , a subtree of a rooted tree includes a particular node and the entire tree structure below it .\u000aTwo trees A and B are considered same if age(A->root ) = age(B->root) and subtree rooted at A->left is same as subtree rooted at B->left and subtree rooted at A->right is same as subtree rooted B->right .\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of chefs in Head Chef's restaurant.
