He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings.\u000aFor example, the W string can be formed from "aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd" such as:\u000a    a\u000a     a             d\u000a      a     #     d\u000a       a   b c   d\u000a        a b   c d\u000a         #     #\u000aHe also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings.\u000aMore formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand):\u000aThe string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters.

aVKira likes to play with strings very much. Moreover he likes the shape of 'W' very much. He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings.
p17
aVFor example, the W string can be formed from "aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd" such as:
p18
aV    a

aVHe also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings.
p25
aVMore formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand):
p26
aVThe string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be P1 < P2 < P3 (indexes are 0-origin).
p27
aVEach substring of S[0, P1\u22121], S[P1+1, P2\u22121], S[P2+1, P3\u22121], S[P3+1, |S|\u22121] contains exactly one kind of characters, where S[a, b] denotes the non-empty substring from a+1th character to b+1th character, and |S| denotes the length of string S (See Note for details).
p28
aVNow, his friend Ryuk gives him a string S and asks him to find the length of the longest W string which is a subsequence of S, with only one condition that there must not be any '#' symbols between the positions of the first and the second '#' symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the "positions" we are looking at are in S), i.e. suppose the index of the '#'s he chooses to make the W string are P1, P2, P3 (in increasing order) in the original string S, then there must be no index i such that S[i] = '#' where P1 < i < P2 or P2 < i < P3.

aVHelp Kira and he won't write your name in the Death Note.

aVNote:
p31
aVFor a given string S, let S[k] denote the k+1th character of string S, and let the index of the character S[k] be k. Let |S| denote the length of the string S. And a substring of a string S is a string S[a, b] = S[a] S[a+1] ... S[b], where 0 \u2264 a \u2264 b < |S|. And a subsequence of a string S is a string S[i0] S[i1] ... S[in\u22121], where 0 \u2264 i0 < i1 < ... < in\u22121 < |S|.
p32
aVFor example, let S be the string "kira", then S[0] = 'k', S[1] = 'i', S[3] = 'a', and |S| = 4. All of S[0, 2] = "kir", S[1, 1] = "i", and S[0, 3] = "kira" are substrings of S, but "ik", "kr", and "arik" are not. All of "k", "kr", "kira", "kia" are subsequences of S, but "ik", "kk" are not.
p33
aVFrom the above definition of W string, for example, "a#b#c#d", "aaa#yyy#aaa#yy", and "o#oo#ooo#oooo" are W string, but "a#b#c#d#e", "#a#a#a", and "aa##a#a" are not.
