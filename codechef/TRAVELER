V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aChef likes to travel very much. He plans some travel routes and wants to know their lengths. He hired you to make these calculations. But be careful, some of the routes are incorrect. There may be some misspelling in city names or there will be no road between some two consecutive cities in the route. Also note that Chef hates to visit the same city twice during his travel. Even the last city should differ from the first. Two consecutive cities in the route should also be different. So you need to check these conditions for the given routes too.\u000a\u000aYou will be given the list of all cities and all roads between them with their lengths. All roads are one-way. Also you will be given the list of all travel routes that Chef plans. For each route you should check whether it is correct and find its length in this case.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct.\u000a\u000aThe third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file.\u000a\u000aNext line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef. Each of the next T lines contains positive integer K followed by K strings, names of cities of the current route. Cities are given in order in which Chef will visit them during his travel.\u000a\u000aAll strings in the input file composed only of lowercase, uppercase letters of the English alphabet and hyphens. Each string is non-empty and has length at most 20. If some line of the input file contains more then one element than consecutive elements of this line are separated by exactly one space. Each line of the input file has no leading or trailing spaces.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each travel route from the input file output a single line containing word ERROR if the route is incorrect and its length otherwise.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 <= N <= 50\u000a0 <= M <= N * (N - 1)\u000a1 <= D <= 20000\u000a1 <= T <= 50\u000a1 <= K <= 50\u000a1 <= length of each string <= 20\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a5\u000aDonetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood\u000a9\u000aDonetsk Kiev 560\u000aKiev New-York 7507\u000aNew-York Miami 1764\u000aMiami Hollywood 28\u000aHollywood Miami 30\u000aMiami New-York 1764\u000aKiev Donetsk 550\u000aHollywood New-York 1736\u000aNew-York Hollywood 1738\u000a13\u000a5 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood\u000a5 Hollywood Miami New-York Kiev Donetsk\u000a3 Donetsk Kiev Donetsk\u000a2 Kyiv New-York\u000a3 New-York Hollywood Miami\u000a2 New-York Miami\u000a3 Hollywood New-York Miami\u000a4 Donetsk Kiev Miami Hollywood\u000a2 Donetsk Hollywood\u000a1 Donetsk\u000a2 Mumbai Deli\u000a6 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood New-York\u000a2 Miami Miami\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a9859\u000aERROR\u000aERROR\u000aERROR\u000a1768\u000a1764\u000a3500\u000aERROR\u000aERROR\u000a0\u000aERROR\u000aERROR\u000aERROR\u000aExplanation\u000aThe 2nd route is incorrect since there is no road from New-York to Kiev.
