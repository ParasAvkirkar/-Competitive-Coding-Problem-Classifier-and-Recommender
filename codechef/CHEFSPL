aVOne day, Chef prepared D brand new dishes. He named the i-th dish by a string Si. After the cooking, he decided to categorize each of these D dishes as special or not.
p18
aVA dish Si is called special if it's name (i.e. the string Si) can be represented in the form of a double string by removing at most one (possibly zero) character from it's name from any position.
p19
aVA string is called a double string if it can be represented as a concatenation of two identical, non-empty strings.
p20
aVe.g. "abab" is a double string as it can be represented as "ab" + "ab" where + operation denotes concatenation.
