V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aChef had a hard time arguing with his friend, and after getting a great old kick Chef saw a colored array with N cells, numbered from 1 to N.\u000aThe kick was so strong that Chef suddenly understood the rules of the game.\u000aEach cell is painted with a color. Here the colors are numbered from 1 to M.\u000aFor any cell i, Chef can repaint it with any color q, and the cost of such operation is Ci,q points.\u000aHowever Chef can do at most K repaintings (0 repaintings is possible).\u000aAfter performing all repaintings, each cell will have some color. For each cell i, if cell i has color q then Chef will receive Bi,q points.\u000aNow Chef is wondering how many points can he receive in total when he repaints optimally.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\u000aThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of cells and the number of colors, the maximal possible number of repaintings respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial colors of the cells. Then N lines follow. The ith line of them contains M integers Bi1, Bi2, ..., BiM, where Bij denotes how many points Chef will receive if the cell i will be painted with j-th color after all operations. Then N lines follow. The ith line of them contains M integers Ci1, Ci2, ..., CiM, where Cij denotes how many points Chef will lose if he repaints the cell i with color j.\u000aNote: Be careful that the size of input files can be large.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximal possible points.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\u000a0 \u2264 K \u2264 1000\u000a1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 1000\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 M\u000a0 \u2264 Bi,j \u2264 1000\u000a0 \u2264 Ci,j \u2264 1000\u000aIf j = Ai, then Ci,j = 0\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a1\u000a4 2 1\u000a1 1 2 2\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a3 1\u000a0 1\u000a0 1\u000a1 0\u000a1 0\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a5\u000aExplanation:\u000aFor this sample, we can repaint only once, since K = 1.
