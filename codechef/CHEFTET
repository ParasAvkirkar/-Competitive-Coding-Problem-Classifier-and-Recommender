Today Chef's mother wanted to him play something else and brought an array for her son. That is why Chef now decided to play Tetris with arrays. Here are the rules of the game:\u000aChef has an array A consisting of N positive integers. This is a base array.\u000aChef has an array B consisting of N positive integers.

aVChef loves Tetris. He keeps on playing Tetris all the time. Today Chef's mother wanted to him play something else and brought an array for her son. That is why Chef now decided to play Tetris with arrays. Here are the rules of the game:
p18
aVChef has an array A consisting of N positive integers. This is a base array.
p19
aVChef has an array B consisting of N positive integers. He placed this array directly above the array A. Imagine that array B is falling on array A, such that number Bi is directly above the number Ai initially.
p20
aVIf element Bi falls on Ai, Ai gets increased by Bi.
p21
aVEach element Bi can be dropped by Chef on either Ai-1, Ai or Ai+1.
p22
aVChef can't drop element out of array (for example he can't drop B0 on A-1).
