V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aTeddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of N words.\u000aOf course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner.\u000aNote that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R.\u000aDetermine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
