V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aThis winter our chef plans to unveil his latest creation - Cube Cakes. As the name suggests, this new delicacy is a cake in the form of a perfect cube with secret ingredients from the chef's inventory. Since it is a relatively new creation of the chef, he wants to master the ability to make perfectly identical Cube Cakes. For this, he wants you to write a program that will calculate the similarity between two given Cube Cakes.\u000a\u000a\u000aEach Cube Cake can be represented as a cube of size N where each cell of the cube contains a lowercase alphabet ('a'-'z'). The similarity between two Cube Cakes ( of size N each ) is defined as the maximum sized common sub-cube that exists at exactly the same position in both the Cube Cakes. Two sub-cubes are said to be common if at-least P% of their corresponding characters are equal. You need to find the size S of the largest such sub-cube and also the number of common sub-cubes of size S in the Cube Cake.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
