V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aChef likes to play with graphs a lot. Today he created a graph in the following way. He first lays down N nodes in a circle. The nodes nodes are numbered from 1 to N, in the clockwise order, i.e. the node 2 is followed by 1, 3 is followed by 2, and 1 is followed by N. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they don't have an intermediate vertex placed between them. There is an edge between each adjacent pair of vertices, so there are total N such edges. Each edge has an integer associated with it (may be negative).\u000aChef wants to find a walk from node start to node end using the above described edges. Chef has to pay cost for each edge in the walk equal to the integer associated with the edge. He wants to minimize the total cost he will incur. Also, Chef does not like to move through an edge more than twice. Find out minimum cost that Chef has to pay.\u000aNote that a walk from a node u to v can contain repeated vertices in it. Please refer to link for a formal definition.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\u000aThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes.\u000aThe second line contains N space-separated integers R1, R2, ..., RN denoting the integer of the rib from node i to node (i % N) + 1. Note that RN is an integer on a rib from node N to node 1.\u000aThe third line contains two integers start and end denoting the first and the last node of the walk.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimal possible cost Chef need to pay.\u000aConstraints\u000a-106 \u2264 Ri \u2264 106\u000a1 \u2264 start < end \u2264 N\u000aSubtasks\u000aSubtask #1 (20 points): 1 \u2264 sum of N \u2264 20; 1 \u2264 N \u2264 8\u000aSubtask #2 (30 points): 1 \u2264 sum of all N \u2264 103; 1 \u2264 N \u2264 200\u000aSubtask #3 (50 points): 1 \u2264 sum of all N \u2264 106; 1 \u2264 N \u2264 2 × 105\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a4\u000a1 2 1 1\u000a1 3\u000a5\u000a-5 100 100 100 2\u000a1 5\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a2\u000a-8\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.

Now, he can not use the edge between 1 and 2 again, as he has traversed the edge already twice. Now he will go from node 1 to node 4 by paying a cost of 2.
